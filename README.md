# üßë‚Äçüíª About This Repository
This repository focuses on leveraging **LLamaIndexing** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to improve **MLOps pipelines**. The main goal is to integrate fast and efficient natural language query systems with structured data to enhance machine learning workflows. I have worked on this to have some experience to achieve vectorization of a given word and make a search inside a SQL database and if not able to find the word, then ask the LLM about the word using the API key of the LLM. Then using prompt engineering, I retrieved the exact ammont of data I wanted. Then I saved the data inside my database.

I have developed the project using **Python** with a combination of LLamaIndex and LLM models to manage large datasets effectively, focusing on creating a robust indexing and querying system.

### What I Have Done
- Integrated **LLamaIndex** with databases to enable efficient querying.
- Connected **LLMs** for generating insights from structured datasets.
- Developed core functionality in **Python** to ensure compatibility with various MLOps environments.

### What Needs To Be Done
1. Set up a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.
2. Connect the database that you want to query using LLamaIndex.
3. Configure the LLM model for specific tasks (e.g., text generation, summarization).
4. Run the Python scripts to execute indexing and querying operations.
5. Also need to create a .env file where you need to store the api keys like this way. OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
